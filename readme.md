## Purpose
This app is to be used as a playground to try out various bits of functionality before implementing on another side-project.
## Sources
So far, the primary source material for this app have come from two YouTube tutorials:
- [Node.js App From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&t=2893s) by Traversy Media
- [Materialize Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gGrbtvASEZSlFEYBnPkmff) by The Net Ninja
## Extensions
In addition to the work guided by the tutorials, I have extended the functionality of the app in the following ways:
- added Microsoft Azure Authentication (using Passport)
- added an about page which included the opportunity to add new routes and practice templating with Handlebars
- create contact form which collects data and saves to db *(planned)*
- connect form data to email which sends content to an address *(planned)*
- add page which records audio and saves it to a file system, recording the saved path to MongoDB *(planned)*
- create ability to generate a new page from a request and have the page address persist *(planned)*
## Technology used
- Node.js 
- Express.js 
- MongoDB 
- Mongoose (MongoDB object modelling for Node)
- Handlebars for templating
- Passport for authentication
- Materialize for front-end design
